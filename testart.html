							   		<p> We've already mentioned that we're high on Jarvis Landry and Ryan Tannehill this week so were bringing Cameron to the party as well. A talented pass-catcher in his own right, Cameron struggled with concussions last year. Expect a bounce-back campaign, starting with a strong showing in Week 1. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Jared Cook vs. Seahawks </h1>
							   		<p> Against the Seahawks? For some odd reason, the 'Hawks seemed to struggle to contain TEs in 2014. The most memorable performance was Antonio Gates three TD performance in Week 2. Cook is quick, and should be able to enjoy even more success if Kam is out of action.</td>

		                       <td><h1> Tyler Eifert vs. Raiders </h1>
							   		<p> Eifert has been earning rave reviews in the offseason for his improved playmaking. He was said to have been "uncoverable" in practice. In a cupcake matchup against the Raiders, owners can bet that the Eifert hype train will only continue to pick up steam. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Sit of the Week: Owen Daniels vs. Ravens</h1>
								   		<p> The Ravens secondary prides itself on being a physical outfit, holding big names like Jimmy Graham to relatively pedestrian numbers. With a far less talented option like Daniels, expecting anything more than low-end TE1 value is too optimistic.</td>

			                       <td><h1> Kyle Rudolph vs. 49ers </h1>
								   		<p> It seems like Rudolph earning MVP of the Pro Bowl happened just yesterday. Since then, Rudolph has struggled to stay on the field, and against an imposing 49ers corps anchored by Navorro Bowman, Rudolph will struggle to get open looks. Start him at your own risk.  </td>

			                       <td><h1> Eric Ebron vs. Chargers </h1>
								   		<p> Ebron could prove to be a sneaky fantasy option this year, and he figures to see easy matchups with Megatron and Tate being the focal points of hte passing game. In Week 1 however, he will face a secondary that conceded just three touchdowns to tight ends all of last season. Keep him on the bench for now. </td>
