							   		<p> Talk about a revamped unit. With the offseason additions of Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, this defense should be very balanced. Against a suspect offense in the Browns, the Jets should wreak havoc. </td>     
		                   </tr>

		                       <td><h1> Packers DST vs. Bears </h1>
							   		<p> With Kevin White out for the forseeable future and Alshon Jeffery's status for Week 1 still up in the air, the Bears are starved for playmakers. The Packers represent a sneaky matchup-based play, as they should be able to generate consistent pressure against Cutler and company.</td>

		                       <td><h1> Vikings DST vs. 49ers </h1>
							   		<p> The Vikings have a lot of talent on this defense. First rounders Anthony Barr, Trae Waynes, and Harrison Smith should help anchor a strong balanced attack. Against a 49ers offense that has struggled to protect Kaepernick in the past, this could be a great matchup-based play. </td>

								   		<p> While a formidable group in their own right, the Bills are going to have their hands full with the Colts here. Andrew Luck has a bevy of targets at his disposal, and with Gore at running back, the Bills can't load up on coverage. Temper your expectations here in Week 1. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Ravens DST vs. Broncos </h1>
								   		<p> While this offense seems to have lost some of its luster from last year, the Broncos remain a dangerous offensive outfit. With a potent run game, Manning should have no problem moving the chains against the Ravens in Week 1.</td>

			                       <td><h1> Cardinals vs. Saints </h1>
								   		<p> If the preseason was any indication, the Saints offense is nothing to be trifled with. Second year play maker Brandin Cooks and workhorse back Mark Ingram will combine to give Brees plenty of options against the Cardinals. A shootout appears to be in the cards here. </td>
