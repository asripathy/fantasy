	                       <td>Rob Gronkowski</td>
												 <td>The undisputed number one tight end. With Brady's suspension erased, expect big numbers from Gronk.</td>
	                   </tr>

	                       <td>2</td>
	                       <td>Jimmy Graham</td>
												 <td>Graham had a down year last season and Seattle's run heavy offense is not the ideal place to rebound. However, Graham
												 is still the second best TE in fantasy.</td>
	                   </tr>

 	                   <tr>
                 	   		<td class ="tier"> Tier 3 </td>
 	                   </tr>
					   		 		<tr>
 					   					<td>3</td>
 											<td>Travis Kelce</td>
											<td>Kelce seems poised for a breakout season this year. The addition of Maclin will also keep defenses honest.</td>
 									</tr>

									<tr>
  					   			<td>4</td>
										<td>Greg Olsen</td>
										<td>Olsen has built great chemistry with Newton over the years. Losing Benjamin will bring in more targets for Olsen but also attract more
										attention from opposing defenses. His ceiling seems capped at around 1000 yds and 6 touchdowns however. </td>
  								</tr>

								 <tr>
  					   		<td>5</td>
									<td>Martellus Bennett</td>
									<td>Bennett will put up big numbers for the first few weeks of the season, as he always does. However, Bennett always seems to show
									a sharp decline in production as the season goes on. Just something to note. </td>

								 <tr>
										<td class ="tier"> Tier 4 </td>
								 </tr>
					 		 <tr>
					 		 	<td>6</td>
								<td>Delaine Walker</td>
								<td>Walker has the potential to put up big numbers. Playing with a rookie QB, Walker can expect plenty of targets, as TEs tend to become their security blanket. </td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								 <td>7</td>
								 <td>Jordan Cameron</td>
								 <td>Tannehill has looked very polished this preseason and should be able to help bring Cameron back to putting up big numbers.</td>
						 </tr>

							<tr>
								<td>8</td>
								<td>Jason Witten</td>
								<td>Witten has been reliable throughout his career and should have solid yet unexciting production this year.</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
							 <td>9</td>
								 <td>Owen Daniels</td>
								 <td>Daniels has the potential to fill in the void left by Julius Thomas. He's a high-risk high-reward prospect.</td>
							 </tr>

					 			<tr>
							 		<td class ="tier"> Tier 5 </td>
								</tr>

							<tr>
									<td>10</td>
									<td>Tyler Eifert</td>
									<td>Although he's in a run heavy offense, Eifert has the potential to get a lot of TDs in the revamped Bengals offense. He's one of our favorites to breakout pick this year.</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
	 						<td>11</td>
	 							<td>Kyle Rudolph</td>
	 							<td>Bridgewater looks good this year and so do his wideouts. Rudolph can play a significant role in an improved Minnesota offense, especially a TE friendly one like Norv Turner's.'</td>
	 					</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>12</td>
								 <td>Julius Thomas</td>
								 <td>If Julius Thomas can look anything like he did in Denver he will be a big steal. He should see a lot of targets, but he is
								 out for the first 2-4 weeks.</td>
						 </tr>

					 </tr>
							<tr>
								<td class ="tier"> Tier 6 </td>
							</tr>
				 <tr>

						<tr>
						 <td>13</td>
							 <td>Zach Ertz</td>
							 <td>Ertz seems to be a little overhyped this season. He is a good player, but with a ton of options in the Eagles offense, we don't think
								 Ertz will be doing anything too crazy this season.</td>
						</tr>

					 <tr>
						 <td>14</td>
							 <td>Dwayne Allen</td>
							 <td>The Colts have a ridiculous number of offensive weapons. Allen did seem to find paydirt frequently last year, however, don't expect consistency.</td>
					 </tr>

					 <tr>
						 <td>15</td>
							 <td>Vernon Davis</td>
							 <td>It's likely his best days are behind him, but if healthy Davis may be able to rebound from last year's inexplicable free fall.</td>
					 </tr>
