	                       <td>Andrew Luck</td>

												 Luck reach another level this year.</td>

	                       <td>Aaron Rodgers</td>
												 <td>The loss of Nelson caused Rodgers to drop a spot, but with his unquestioned talent we
													 could still see Rodgers finish as the season at the top of his position.

	                       <td>Russell Wilson</td>
												 <td>The youngster is arguably the second best QB in the wave of new QBs after Luck. His ability to attack from the ground and
													 air makes him a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.
	                   </tr>

										 <tr>
	                       <td>4</td>
	                       <td>Drew Brees</td>
												 <td>Brees had a down year last year and the loss of Graham won't help the Saints offense. However, an improved offensive line
													 and an encouraging performance from Cooks in the preseason could make this a rebound year for Brees.</td>
	                   </tr>

										<tr>
					   					<td>5</td>
											<td>Ben Roethlisberger</td>
											<td>Big Ben has arguably the best fantasy widout and recieving back on his team. Expect big numbers barring an injury.</td>
										</tr>

										<tr>
 					   					<td>6</td>
 											<td>Peyton Manning</td>
											<td>After more than a decade of sustained excellence, we see a drop-off almost inevitable for Manning due to his aging body. The preseason
												has done nothing to quiet rumors of weakened arm strength. This year, Manning will have to rely even more upon his expreience over any athletic talent.</td>
 										</tr>
 	                   <tr>
                 	   		<td class ="tier"> Tier 3 </td>
 	                   </tr>
					   		 		<tr>
 					   					<td>7</td>
 											<td>Matt Ryan</td>
											<td>Julio Jones is a beast and should help Ryan put up high numbers even with a potentially inefective Roddy White. The O-line
											has also been upgraded from last year.</td>
 									</tr>

									<tr>
  					   			<td>8</td>
										<td>Tom Brady</td>
										<td>Brady is back, and his connection with Gronk should be lethal. However, with significant losses on the defensive end and an unsettled
											runnig back situation, Brady may not get a lot of help from the rest of his team.</td>
  								</tr>

								 <tr>
  					   		<td>9</td>
									<td>Tony Romo</td>
									<td>The loss of Murray will certainly hurt Romo, but with one of the best O-lines and wideouts in the game, Romo should remain a border-line
										QB1 for the season.</td>

								 <tr>
										<td class ="tier"> Tier 4 </td>
								 </tr>
					 		 <tr>
					 		 	<td>10</td>
								<td>Mathew Stafford</td>
								<td>Stafford looks locked and loaded, with two premier pass-catches in Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate in the wings. The selection of dynamic playmaker Ameer Abdullah only makes this offense even more dangerous.</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>11</td>
								<td>Eli Manning</td>
								<td>Injury concerns for Cruz and OBJ hurt Eli's value. Manning has also looked less than spectacular in the preseason.</td>
							</tr>

						 <tr>
							 	<td>12</td>
						 		<td>Ryan Tannehill</td>
						 		<td>Tannehill has looked very good this preseason after securing a big deal in the offseason. Tannehill could have a real breakout campaign</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
								<td>13</td>
								<td>Cam Newton</td>
								<td>Losing the talented Kelvin Benjamin has dropped Newton's potential significantly for the year. His ability to run the ball is
								the only thing keeping him somewhat fantasy relevent.</td>
						</tr>
					 			<tr>
							 		<td class ="tier"> Tier 5 </td>
								</tr>
						<tr>
						 <td>14</td>
							 <td>Joe Flacco</td>
							 <td>Trestman, the "Quarterback Whisperer," may help Flacco, but with Torrey Smith gone we find significant imrpovement unlikely.</td>
						 </tr>

						 <tr>
							 <td>15</td>
								 <td>Philip Rivers</td>
								 <td>Rivers will have to rely even more upon Keenan Allen with the loss of Gates to suspension and Royal to free agency. Although Stevie Johnson was acquired in the offseason, we expect a lack of receiving options to hurt Rivers production this year.</td>
						 </tr>

						<tr>
							<td>16</td>
							 <td>Sam Bradford</td>
							 <td>If healthy, Bradford has the potential rack up a lot of points in the electric Eagles offense. However, his health is a big "if."</td>
					 </tr>

					 <tr>
						 <td>17</td>
							 <td>Blake Bortles</td>
							 <td>Robinson and Julius Thomas give Bortles some solid options to work with. Bortles has also looked fairly promising in the preseason.</td>
					 </tr>

					 <tr>
						<td>18</td>
							<td>Teddy Bridgewater</td>
							<td>Bridgewater looks to improve from his solid rookie campaign with the help of Charles Johnson and Mike Wallace.</td>
					</tr>
				 </tr>
						 <tr>
							 <td class ="tier"> Tier 6 </td>
						 </tr>
				<tr>
	 				<td>19</td>
	 					<td>Andy Dalton</td>
	 					<td>Although he has A.J. Green on his team, Dalton has failed to bring much consistency in his previous seasons. This year the Bengals might look to establish the run game more,
						with a dangerous combination of Hill and Bernanrd.</td>
	 					</tr>
				 <tr>

					<td>20</td>
						<td>Colin Kaepernick</td>
						<td>The Niners have had a disastrous offseason. The whole team looked dysfunctional last year and the loss of several key members certainly doesn't help. If Kaep can show some improvement in his game however, his undeniable athlecism just may make it work. 
						this year.</td>
					</tr>

				 <tr>
					 <td>20</td>
						<td>Carson Palmer</td>
						<td>The injury to Michael Floyd and the increasingly less dangerous Larry Fitzgerald make us skeptical about Palmer's fantasy prospects. Brown could breakout, but as a whole, this offense is missing too many pieces.</td>
				</tr>
