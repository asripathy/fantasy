 							<td>Randall Cobb</td>
							<td>Should be a target monster with the loss of Jordy Nelson. Could easily finish as a top 5 receiver.</td>

							<td>Scary potential as the focal point of a Drew Brees led offense. Value is even higher in PPR leauges. </td>

							<td>T.Y. Hilton</td>
							<td>Offseason acquisitions of Andre Johnson and Phillip Dorsett figure to eat into touches a little. Still an excellent option at the position. </td>

							<td>13</td>
							<td>Jordan Matthews</td>
							<td>Matthews has huge upside in the Eagles fast-paced offense. Much like Brandin Cooks, Matthews should see even higher value in PPR leagues. </td>

   					   		<td>15</td>

							<td>As the undisputed #2 receiver in Green Bay, 1000 yds and 8 tds appear to be a very conservative floor. Adams is a bona-fide WR2.</td>

    				   	   <tr>
    					   		<td>16</td>
    							<td>Emmanuel Sanders</td>
								<td>Sanders should still be effective in 2015, but his numbers should take a hit with a more run-based attack. Another year of 1000+ yds and 7+ tds appears to be in the cards. </td>
    						</tr>
 						<tr>
 							<td>17</td>
 							<td>Keenan Allen</td>
							<td>Expect a bounce-back year from Allen. Suspension of Gates only boosts early season value. </td>

							<td>Landry seems like a good bet to eclipse 90 receptions in 2015. Even more valuable in PPR leagues. </td>
 						</tr>
 						<tr>
 							<td>23</td>
 							<td>Jeremy Maclin</td>
							<td>Maclin's numbers should fall after leaving the Eagles high octane offense. But not by much. He's still a solid WR2. </td>
 						</tr>
 						<tr>
 							<td>24</td>
 							<td>Allen Robinson</td>
							<td>Watch out for A-Rob. He could be the first Jags receiver to post a 1000 yard campaign since 2005. </td>

   						</tr>
   				   	   <tr>
   					   		<td>27</td>

							<td>V-Jax remains one of the safer options later in drafts. Expect an uptick in touchdowns from last year and a slight decrease in targets. </td>
   						</tr>
    				   	   <tr>
    					   		<td>28</td>
    							<td>Martavis Bryant</td>
								<td>Bryant's 4 game suspension shouldn't stop you from drafting this awfully talented playmaker. </td>
    						</tr>

 							<td>29</td>
 							<td>Charles Johnson</td>
							<td>Tabbed as a popular breakout pick, Charles Johnson should flourish as the WR1 in Mike Zimmer's offense.</td>
