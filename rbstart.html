		                       <td><h1> Start of the Week: Jonathan Stewart vs. Jaguars </h1>
							   		<p> All signs point to a run-heavy approach for the Panthers this season. The loss of Kelvin Benjamin coupled with the unimpressive receiving corps in Carolina should lead them to rely upon the run more than they have in the past. With a juicy matchup against the Jaguars, Stewart should have a field day. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Doug Martin vs. Titans </h1>
							   		<p> If the Titans preseason showing was any indication, their defense is going to have a tough time getting stops this season. On the other side, Martin looks like he may have rediscovered the burst that made him so dangerous in his rookie season. Start Martin as your RB2 with confidence. </td>

		                       <td><h1> T.J. Yeldon vs. Panthers </h1>
							   		<p> It appears as though the Jaguars intend to use Yeldon as a true three-down workhorse back. While the offense as a whole might drag his value down, the Jaguars offense appear to be trending in the right direction. Look for Yeldon to return solid RB3/flex value in his Week 1 tilt with the Panthers. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Chris Ivory vs. Browns </h1>
							   		<p> While the Browns selection of Danny Shelton should help shore up their run defense, the unit as a whole should still be largely below average. Ivory projects to be a true workhorse back in New York, and should see solid production in Week 1. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Sit of the Week: Melvin Gordon vs. Lions</h1>
								   		<p> Don't let the offseason loss of Suh fool you into thinking this defense is any less potent. Heralded run-stuffer Haloti Ngata should ensure this unit remains a fearsome bunch. A tough matchup coupled with question marks surrounding Gordon's workload make him a low end RB2 in week 1. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Joique Bell vs. Chargers </h1>
								   		<p> It's probably best for owners to temper expectations for Bell until we find out how the workload is going to be split between him, Abdullah, and Riddick. While he should still see plenty of goal-line work, Bell's role is becoming increasingly uncertain. Start him if you must, but only as a flex. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Tre Mason vs. Seahawks </h1>
								   		<p> Mason's status for Week 1 is currently unclear, as he sustained a hamstring injury in the preseason. If he does play however, it shouldn't make too much of an impact on your lineup, as he faces a brutal matchup in the Seahawks. </td>     
			                   </tr>
			                       <td><img src = "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/ocsUs4vGpzX_AWPRGMEHrw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/person/Ysports/deangelo-williams-football-headshot-photo.jpg" width= "90px" height= "110px"></td>
			                       <td><h1> DeAngelo Williams vs. Patriots </h1>
								   		<p> Don't expect too much production out of Williams in Week 1 against a formidable Patriots defense. His value as a handcuff to Bell is handicapped by the lack of a favorable matchup in the first two weeks of the season (He plays the 49ers in Week 2). </td>
