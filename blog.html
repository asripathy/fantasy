		<div id = "content"> Hey guys! This is our first official blog post to commemorate the launch of FantasyStars! Our team has worked really hard to set up a website that we believe will prove very useful this season. From our updated rankings to our weekly Waiver Wire column, you'll find everything you need to be successful in fantasy football right here. This post will cover what you can expect in terms of content, and some of the features we plan on rolling out in the near future.
			<h3> Weekly Content </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Columns- Before each week of action, we'll post a <strong>Start 'Em Sit'Em</strong> article, with advice on who you should consider starting or sitting for that week. After all the games are over, we'll have a <strong>Waiver Wire</strong> post that goes over the must-have pickups that could really help your team. Finally, we'll have a <strong>Rapid Reaction</strong> post, that goes over the biggest takeaways from each week of NFL action. We'll review the week's notable performances and what they mean to the fantasy world. </li>
