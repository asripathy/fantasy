		<h1 id = "title"> Beware Joseph Randle </h1>
		<p id = "date"> 9/6/15 </p>

		<div id = "content"> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		One of the hottest names in fantasy circles entering August was one Joseph Randle. Touted as the next big thing by fantasy gurus, Randle's stock skyrocketed. What's not to like? The man boasted an impressive 6.7 YPC in his limited work behind Demarco Murray. That was good enough to finish #3 amongst all players who rushed at least 50 times on the year. Even more exciting, he gets to run behind what is without a doubt the best offensive line in the NFL. So why are we not as high on Randle as other experts? Well lets go over some other facts that may change your mind a little.  <br> 
		<br>
		Joseph Randle's ADP topped out at an unsettlingly high of 32, however with news of a dreaded RBBC, it has started to dip to more of a 6th round price. While this might appear like pretty good value for a back with so much upside, which we highlighted above, people are ignoring the numerous warning signs surrounding his situation. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Most casual observers can agree that Randle is not exactly an above average running back in the NFL. Aside from in Dallas, Randle would probably not be handed anywhere close to a starter's role on an NFL team. There's a reason that Randle only saw limited work behind Murray last year. Even with the dominant offensive line, it would be disrespectful to claim Randle is anywhere near the same caliber of a back as Murray. Why don't we look at some numbers to prove my point.
		Joseph Randle's YPC might be a little misleading for a simple reason- he has never had to handle significant work before. Primarily used as a change-of-pace back, Randle's YPC has been inflated by a few long runs he's managed to break out. When considering games where Randle has carried the ball at least 10 times however, a troubling trend appears. He averaged a mediocre 3.5 yards per carry. Compare that to Demarco Murray's 5.2 YPC in 2013 and 4.7 YPC last year. Granted it has been two years since his awful 11 carry 17 yard performance against the Redskins, and improvement might be possible, but these are statistics worth noting. Oh and by the way, one of the players who ranked ahead of Randle in YPC was Blake Bortles. As much as we love Bortles, this just goes to show how 50 carries can still be far too easily influenced by a home-run play. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		But the most troublesome fact has nothing to do with Randle itself. It has to do with the concept of drafting for situation as opposed to talent. While situation certainly plays a significant role in fantasy, it can't be allowed to take precedence over the actual talent of the player in question. A perfect example of this is a player from last year who had been promoted to a starter in what was widely considered a great situation. His fantasy stock skyrocketed. Here are some of the quotes about him from last year. See if you recognize anything. From NFL.com: "He has entered the perfect storm of opportunity as the top back in ___, running behind a stout offensive line and playing alongside ___. He's rushing behind a top-notch offensive line and taking his cues from one of the best football minds in the world in ____." From CBS: "His biggest benefit is playing next to _____. In 32 games as the starter for the _____ in the regular season, ____ has helped _____ running backs reach double digits in Fantasy points 23 times." <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		If you haven't figured it out already, these quotes are referring to notorious bust Montee Ball. Ball taught fantasy owners a painful lesson last year: even in a great situation, talent always wins out. Case in point, the midseason arrival of C.J. Anderson. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		So what does this all mean for you in fantasy? If you haven't drafted yet, do yourself a favor and steer clear of Randle unless you get him at a significant discount. There is a back to own in Dallas, but it's not Randle. It seems increasingly likely that the uber-talented Christine Michael will become the starter eventually. His talent is simply far greater than whoever else Dallas has on its roster. If he's available on the waiver wire, take a flier on him. He just might be the C.J. Anderson of 2015.
