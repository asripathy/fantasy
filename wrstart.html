		                       <td><h1> Start of the Week: Davante Adams vs. Bears </h1>
							   		<p> The best QB in the NFL takes on one of the worst secondaries. The Packers should dominate the Bears, with Adams being a big part of it. We only hope that the game doesn't get too out of hand, otherwise the starters might head to the bench early. He is a low-end WR1 in Week 1. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Jarvis Landry vs. Redskins </h1>
							   		<p> With the news that DeVante Parker will be ready for Week 1, Landry's value does take a small hit. However, against a shaky Redskins secondary, Landry should prove to be a strong WR2 play. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Vincent Jackson vs. Titans </h1>
							   		<p> With a lot of attention headed towards Mike Evans (rightfully so), it appears fantasy owners have forgotten another fantasy stud: V-Jax. Keep in mind Vincent Jackson tallied almost identical yardage to Mike Evans, with even more targets. Jackson figures to play a heavy role, and is a high upside WR2. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Nelson Agholor vs. Falcons </h1>
							   		<p> While many are expecting big things out of Matthews this season, don't forget Agholor. Early indications are that Matthews will play a majority of his snaps from the slot, meaning Agholor should have plenty of opportunities on the outside. Against a weak secondary, Agholor should be able to easily return WR2 outing. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Sit of the Week: Steve Smith Sr. vs. Broncos</h1>
								   		<p> Steve Smith continues to defy the odds and put up respectable fantasy numbers. However, a tough matchup with the Broncos in Week 1 means he will have his work cut out for him. The lack of comparable talent in Baltimore means he should see a lot more double teams. Smith is a low-end flex play in Week 1.</td>

			                       <td><h1> Sammy Watkins vs. Colts </h1>
								   		<p> The good news for Watkins is that he finally appears to have help in the form of a capable QB. Tyrod Taylor looked more than serviceable in the preseason, giving the Bills a legit dual-threat QB. However, a date with Vontae Davis does put a dampener on Watkins Week 1 prospects. Start him as a low-end WR2. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Desean Jackson vs. Dolphins </h1>
								   		<p> Jackson has always been a boom or bust weapon. His Week 1 bout with the Dolphins appears to be of the latter variety. The Dolphins should generate a ton of pressure against a suspect line, meaning the deep ball might get pushed aside for the shorter/intermediate routes. Don't forget about Brent Grimes either, as he figures to play a huge part in holding Jackson to what should be a flex play.   </td>

			                       <td><h1> Mike Wallace vs. 49ers </h1>
								   		<p> In what figures to be a low scoring affair against the 49ers, expect the run game to take front and center. The presence of two Pro bowlers in Antoine Bethea and Eric Reid figure to make Wallace's chances of a long bomb all the more improbable.  </td>
