							   		<p> Noticing a trend here? Tough defenses lead to inefficient red-zone trips. Inefficient red-zone trips lead to fantasy points galore for kickers. Novak is a top play in Week 1. </td>

							   		<p> While Forbath reportedly struggled in training camp, he has been a reliable play throughout his career. With the inconsistent Cousins under center, Forbath should have plenty of opportunities to convert field goals on stalled drives. </td>
