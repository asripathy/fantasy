							   		<p> Tannehill will kick off the season with an extremely favorable matchup against the Redskins. Expect him to throw early and often against what proved to be one of the most shaky secondaries in the league last year. 250+ yds and 2-3 tds should prove to be safe expectations. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Carson Palmer vs. Saints </h1>
							   		<p> The Saints secondary was dealt a cruel blow with the loss of starting cornerback Keenan Lewis to hip surgery. With the secondary being already short of talent, especially with Jairus Byrd still on the PUP, this should prove to be an enticing matchup for Palmer. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Eli Manning vs. Cowboys </h1>
							   		<p> The Cowboys lost top corner Orlando Scandrick to the IR last week with a torn ACL. Coming off the heels of an unexpectedly good season, the numerous holes in the Cowboys secondary should hold this unit back from enjoying similar success. Expect Manning and company to roll. </td>

		                       <td><h1> Sam Bradford vs. Falcons </h1>
							   		<p> The Eagles offense looked like a well-oiled machine in the preseason. With Jordan Matthews and rookie wideout Nelson Agholor leading the way, the Eagles receiving corps should have no problem getting open against a weak Falcons secondary. Expect big things from Bradford in Week 1. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Sit of the Week: Nick Foles vs. Seahawks</h1>
								   		<p> Even if Kam Chancellor's holdout extends into the regular season, the Seahawks are simply a defense to avoid at all costs. While Nick Foles might have a productive year in St. Louis, you're better off benching him in Week 1 in what figures to be a nightmare of a matchup. </td>

			                       <td><h1> Teddy Bridgewater vs. 49ers </h1>
								   		<p> Don't count this 49ers defense out just yet. With arguably one of the top safety duos in Antoine Bethea and Eric Reid, along with a plethora of promising pass rushers(see Eli Harold, Aaron Lynch, Corey Lemonier), this unit could surprise in 2015. </td>

								   		<p> The Bengals were one of only two teams to force more interceptions than the number of touchdowns allowed (20 vs. 18). With Geno Atkins bringing new life to this pass rush, Carr figures to have his hands full come Week 1. </td>
